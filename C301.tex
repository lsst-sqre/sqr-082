% Note the position of the comma between the author name and the

% Authors surnames should come after first names or initials, eg John Smith, or J. Smith.
% Author names should be separated by commas.
% The final author should be preceded by "and".
% Affiliations should not be repeated across multiple \affil commands. If several
% authors share an affiliation this should be in a single \affil which can then
% be referenced for several author names. If only one affiliation, no footnotes are needed.

\begin{abstract}
At Rubin Data Management we set out early in construction to create a healthy documentation culture.
In order to provide a good UX for documentation contributors, we developed a documentation infrastructure (now also used by the NASA SPHEREx project) that values low-friction documentation creation and guaranteed-accurate documentation techniques.
By using development tools such as GitHub Actions, Slack bots and Jupyter Notebooks, we are battling successfully the traditional view of documentation as the chore of last resort for both writers and readers.

% These lines show examples of subject index entries. At this stage these have to commented
% out, and need to be on separate lines. Eventually, they will be automatically uncommented
% and used to generate entries in the Subject Index at the end of the Proceedings volume.
% Don't leave these in! - replace them with ones relevant to your paper.

\section{Docs like code}

% - Enable the team to write Docs
% - Docs like code fits our team's workflow.
% - Reference Docs
% - Exploration of new technologies

\section{Documentation deployment}

% Automatic deployment
% Features beyond read the docs

\section{Templates}

Initial project set up is an impediment to docs-like-code projects.
Not only do documentation projects require boilerplate infrastructure files that are outside the scope of contributors, they may also require configuration with outside systems like GitHub and web hosting that requires expert knowledge and permissions.
Templates mitigate this challenge so that any contributor can start a project without deep documentation platform expertise.

Rubin maintains templates for all types of software and documentation projects in a single repository.
The template system is built upon Cookiecutter, augmented with our own Templatekit package.
An example of each template is rendered into the repository, which provides a useful documentation reference for maintainers of projects.

By integrating templates with a Slack bot, templates are accessible to anyone in the Rubin organization.
Within Slack, a developer can configure values for a template, and the bot provisions the source repository, renders the template into it, and performs expert configuration on behalf of the developer (for example, registration with the documentation deployment system).
With this system, a team member is able to start a new code or documentation project and have it published to the web in a few minutes.

It is important to reduce the boilerplate code footprint in templates since any code can become technical debt.
We have had success in refactoring continuous integration and deployment workflows with GitHub Action's reusable workflows and custom actions.
Such works become centrally maintainable, and updates to deployment workflows often don't require any change in individual projects.
