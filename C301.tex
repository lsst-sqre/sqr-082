% Note the position of the comma between the author name and the 
% affiliation number.
% Authors surnames should come after first names or initials, eg John Smith, or J. Smith.
% Author names should be separated by commas.
% The final author should be preceded by "and".
% Affiliations should not be repeated across multiple \affil commands. If several
% authors share an affiliation this should be in a single \affil which can then
% be referenced for several author names. If only one affiliation, no footnotes are needed.

% There should be one \aindex line (commented out) for each author. These are used to
% build up the author index for the Proceedings. The surname must come first, followed by

% surname first.
% The Aindex.py command willl create them for you after you have constructed the \author
% The first entry should be the first author, for bold-facing the author index page-reference

\begin{abstract}
At Rubin Data Management we set out early in construction to create a healthy documentation culture.
In order to provide a good UX for documentation contributors, we developed a documentation infrastructure (now also used by the NASA SPHEREx project) that values low-friction documentation creation and guaranteed-accurate documentation techniques.
By using development tools such as GitHub Actions, Slack bots and Jupyter Notebooks, we are battling successfully the traditional view of documentation as the chore of last resort for both writers and readers.

% These lines show examples of subject index entries. At this stage these have to commented
% out, and need to be on separate lines. Eventually, they will be automatically uncommented
% and used to generate entries in the Subject Index at the end of the Proceedings volume.
% Don't leave these in! - replace them with ones relevant to your paper.
